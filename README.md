# TH2A single cell sorting
### Online tools for TH2A cells identification based on single cell sequencing data

This Online tool was created by the shiny app which allows you to identification the TH2A cells in your own single cell sequencing data

## Input the trained model (.rds)

you can input our SVM trained model ([downloaded here](https://github.com/chenxi199506/TH2Asorting/blob/main/trained%20model.rds))

OR 

you can input your own trained model (have to be .rds file)

## Input you single cell data (.csv)

You can input the single cell data (.csv) here or checking for the example data ([downloaded here](https://github.com/chenxi199506/TH2Asorting/blob/main/example.csv))

## Cut-off 

The cut-off value which to define the TH2A cells
