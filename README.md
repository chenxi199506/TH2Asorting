# TH2A single cell sorting
### Online tools for TH2A cells identification based on single cell sequencing data

This Online tool was created by the shiny app which allows you to identification the TH2A cells in your own single cell sequencing data

[https://chenxi2023.shinyapps.io/th2asorting/](https://chenxi2023.shinyapps.io/th2asorting/)

## 01 Input the trained model (.rds)

you can input our SVM trained model: **trained model.rds** ([downloaded here](https://github.com/chenxi199506/TH2Asorting/blob/main/trained%20model.rds))

**OR** 

you can input your own trained model (have to be **.rds** file)

## 02 Input you single cell data (.csv)

You can input your own single cell data (.csv) here or checking for the example data ([downloaded here](https://github.com/chenxi199506/TH2Asorting/blob/main/example.csv))

Noteï¼š the .csv file MUST include five colnames including KLRB1	ZC2HC1A	CD3E	GPR183	PTGS2
